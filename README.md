# My-Dose

My Dose is an light weight mobile insulin calculation app. Users can securely sign up and register for an account and get started right away. Upon initial sign-up the app will ask users to input some general information about their insulin sensitivity factor, carb ratio and target blood glucose. The application will save and display this data everytime the user goes to make a calculation, making the calculation process quick and simple. The application will also save the value of the calculated insulin dose as well as the time the dose was taken in a log so that insulin requirements can be reviewed by the users physician.
